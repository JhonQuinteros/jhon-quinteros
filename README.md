The process of transform a propose to a new feature is made in five stages (input the propose, describe it and show potential challenges, describe the syntax, refinement and feedback, inclusion in the ECMAScript)

Also the engines add some features that are not defined in the specification i.e: the Console.log(), alert(), the REPL, etc…
